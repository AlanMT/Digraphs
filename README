Getting Digraphs                                
----------------

To get the latest version of the package, download the archive file 

    digraphs-x.x.tar.gz

from 

    http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/digraphs.php

and inside the 'pkg' subdirectory of your GAP installation unpack
digraphs-x.x.tar.gz using:

    gunzip digraphs-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf digraphs-x.x.tar

This will create a subdirectory 'digraphs-x.x'.

Installation
------------

It is assumed that you have a working copy of GAP with version number 4.7.3 or
higher.  The  most  up-to-date  version  of  GAP  and instructions on how to
install it can be obtained from the main GAP webpage
  
  http://www.gap-system.org
  
The  following  is  a  summary of the steps that should lead to a successful
installation of Digraphs:

 1.  download the package archive 'digraphs-x.x.tar.gz' from

       http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/digraphs.php

 2.  unzip and untar the file 'digraphs-x.x.tar.gz' using
 
        gunzip digraphs-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf digraphs-x.x.tar
    
     this should create a directory called 'digraphs-x.x'.

 3.  locate  the  'pkg'  directory  of your GAP directory, which contains the
     directories 'lib', 'doc' and so on. Move the directory 'digraphs-x.x'
     into the 'pkg' directory (if it is not there already).

 4.  start GAP in the usual way.

 5.  type LoadPackage("digraphs");

 6.  compile the documentation by typing DigraphsMakeDoc();
