  This is the introduction.<P/>

  A <E>digraph</E> <M>E=(E^0,E^1,r,s)</M>, also known as a 
  <E>directed graph</E>, consists of a set of vertices <M>E^0</M> and a set of 
  edges <M>E^1</M> together with functions <M>s, r: E^1 \to E^0</M>, called 
  the <E>source</E> and <E>range</E>, respectively.

  An edge is called a <E>loop</E> if its source and range are the same.

  A digraph is called a <E>multidigraph</E> if there exist two or more edges
  with the same source and the same range. <P/>

  A <E>directed path</E> on a digraph is a sequence of alternating vertices and
  edges <M>(v_1, e_1, v_2, e_2, ..., e_{n-1}, v_n)</M> such that each edge
  <M>e_i</M> has source <M>v_i</M> and range <M>v_{i+1}</M>, and no vertex is
  repeated.  A <E>cycle</E> is defined similarly, except that <M>v_1 = v_n</M>.
  
  The <E>length</E> of a directed path or cycle <M>(v_1, e_1, v_2, e_2, ...,
    e_{n-1}, v_n)</M> is equal to <M>n-1</M>, the number of edges it contains.
