  <Prop Name="IsSimpleDirectedGraph" Arg="digraph"/>
  <Returns><K>true</K> or <K>false</K>.</Returns>
  <Description>
    A <E>simple directed graph</E> is one that it does not have multiple 
    edges with equal source and range. In other words, is defined by its
    adjacencies <Ref Attr="Adjacencies"/>. A <E>simple directed graph</E>
    may have loops (but not multiple loops at the same vertex). 
 
    <Example><![CDATA[
gap> gr:=DirectedGraph(rec(vertices:=["a", "b", "c"],
> source:=["a", "b", "b"], range:=["b", "c", "a"]));
<directed graph with 3 vertices, 3 edges>
gap> IsSimpleDirectedGraph(gr);
true
gap> gr:=DirectedGraph(rec(vertices:=[1..3], 
> source:=[1,2,3,1,1,2], range:=[1,2,3,2,3,1]));
<directed graph with 3 vertices, 6 edges>
gap> IsSimpleDirectedGraph(gr);

<#GAPDoc Label="IsUndirectedGraph">
<ManSection>
  <Prop Name="IsUndirectedGraph" Arg="digraph"/>
  <Returns><K>true</K> or <K>false</K>.</Returns>
  <Description>
    An <E>undirected directed graph</E> is one where for each non-loop edge,
    having source <M>u</M> and range <M>v</M>, there is a corresponding edge
    with source v and range u. If there are <M>n</M> edges with source <M>u</M>
    and range <M>v</M>, then there must be precisely <M>n</M> edges with source
    <M>v</M> and range <M>u</M>.
    In other words, an undirected directed graph has a symmetric adjacency 
    matrix <Ref Attr="AdjacencyMatrix"/>.<P/>

    This function returns true if and only if the directed graph <A>digraph</A> 
    is undirected.
    <Example><![CDATA[
gap> gr1 := DirectedGraph( [ [ 2 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 3 ] ] );
<directed graph with 3 vertices, 5 edges>
gap> IsUndirectedGraph(gr1);
true
gap> adj1 := AdjacencyMatrix(gr1);;
gap> Display(adj1);
[ [  0,  1,  0 ],
  [  1,  0,  1 ],
  [  0,  1,  1 ] ]
gap> adj1 = TransposedMat(adj1);
true
gap> gr2 := DirectedGraph( [ [ 2, 3 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 3 ] ] );
<directed graph with 3 vertices, 6 edges>
gap> IsUndirectedGraph(gr2);
false
gap> adj2 := AdjacencyMatrix(gr2);;
gap> Display(adj2);
[ [  0,  1,  1 ],
  [  1,  0,  1 ],
  [  0,  1,  1 ] ]

  <Prop Name="IsFunctionalDirectedGraph" Arg="digraph"/>
  <Returns><K>true</K> or <K>false</K>.</Returns>
  <Description>
    This function returns <K>true</K> if the directed graph <A>digraph</A> is
    functional. <P/>
    
    A directed graph is <E>functional</E> if every vertex is the source of a
    unique edge. 
    <Example><![CDATA[
gap> gr1 := DirectedGraph( [ [ 3 ], [ 2 ], [ 2 ], [ 1 ], [ 6 ], [ 5 ] ] );
<directed graph with 6 vertices, 6 edges>
gap> IsFunctionalDirectedGraph(gr1);

<#GAPDoc Label="IsStronglyConnectedDirectedGraph">
<ManSection>
  <Prop Name="IsStronglyConnectedDirectedGraph" Arg="digraph"/>
  <Returns><K>true</K> or <K>false</K>.</Returns>
  <Description>
    This function returns <K>true</K> if the directed graph <A>digraph</A> is
    strongly connected and <K>false</K> if it is not.  A digraph <A>digraph</A>
    is <E>strongly connected</E> if there is a path from every vertex to every
    other vertex. <P/>

    The method used in this operation is based on Gabow's Algorithm <Cite
      Key="Gabow2000aa"/> and has complexity <M>O(m+n)</M> where <M>m</M> is the
    number of edges (counting multiple edges as one) and <M>n</M> is the number
    of vertices in the directed graph. 
  
    <Example><![CDATA[
gap> cycle:=function(n)
>  local record, i;
>  record:=rec(vertices:=[1..n], source:=[], range:=[]);
>  for i in [0..n-1] do 
>    Add(record.source, i mod Length(record.vertices) + 1);
>    Add(record.range, (i + 1) mod Length(record.vertices) +1);
>  od;
>  return DirectedGraph(record);

<#GAPDoc Label="IsAcyclicDirectedGraph">
<ManSection>
  <Prop Name="IsAcyclicDirectedGraph" Arg="digraph"/>
  <Returns><K>true</K> or <K>false</K>.</Returns>
  <Description>
    Returns <K>true</K> if the directed graph <A>digraph</A> is acyclic and
    <K>false</K> if it is not. A digraph is <E>acyclic</E> if
    there are no cycles, i.e. paths starting and ending at the same vertex. <P/>

    The method used in this operation has complexity <M>O(m+n)</M> where
    <M>m</M> is the number of edges (counting multiple edges as one) and
    <M>n</M> is the number of vertices in the directed graph.
