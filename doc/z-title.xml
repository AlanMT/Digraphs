  <Abstract>
    The &Digraphs; package is a &GAP; package containing methods for graphs,
    digraphs, and multidigraphs.

  <Acknowledgements>
    We would like to thank Chris Jefferson for his help in including the &bliss;
    tool in the package.  We would also like to thank Max Neunh&#246;ffer, who
    wrote the code that inspired this package's methods for computing digraph
    homomorphisms, and Artur Sch&#228;fer, who independently created the same
    algorithm.
